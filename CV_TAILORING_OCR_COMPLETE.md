# CV Tailoring System - OCR & Enhanced Parsing Implementation

## ✅ Complete Feature Set

### 🔧 Core Improvements Implemented

#### 1️⃣ **Format Detection & OCR Support**
- ✅ **Automatic PDF Type Detection**: Distinguishes text-based from image-based PDFs
- ✅ **Tesseract.js OCR Integration**: Extracts text from scanned/image-based PDFs
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Real-time OCR progress logging
- ✅ **Fallback Handling**: Clear user messages when OCR fails

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Detects PDF type (text/image/unknown)
function detectPdfType(arrayBuffer: ArrayBuffer): 'text' | 'image' | 'unknown'

// OCR extraction for image-based PDFs
async function extractTextWithOCR(arrayBuffer: ArrayBuffer): Promise<string>
```

#### 2️⃣ **Text Extraction & Cleanup**
- ✅ **Multi-Method PDF Parsing**: 
  - Method 1: PDF text operators (Tj, TJ)
  - Method 2: BT...ET text blocks
  - Method 3: ASCII extraction fallback
- ✅ **DOCX Parsing**: Using Mammoth library for reliable DOCX text extraction
- ✅ **Text Standardization**: Removes artifacts, normalizes spacing, fixes punctuation
- ✅ **Character Cleanup**: Removes non-printable characters and OCR artifacts

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Standardizes and cleans all extracted text
function standardizeExtractedText(text: string): string

// Normalizes section headers for consistency
function standardizeSectionHeaders(text: string): string
```

**Section Standardization Mappings:**
- `WORK EXPERIENCE` ← work history, employment history, professional experience
- `EDUCATION` ← academic background, qualifications, educational background
- `SKILLS` ← technical skills, core competencies, key skills
- `SUMMARY` ← professional summary, profile, objective, career summary
- `CONTACT` ← contact information, personal details, contact details

#### 3️⃣ **Enhanced Error Handling**
- ✅ **OCR-Specific Errors**:
  - `OCR_FAILED`: OCR process failed
  - `OCR_INSUFFICIENT_TEXT`: Insufficient text extracted from image
- ✅ **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear instructions for each error type
- ✅ **Graceful Fallbacks**: No silent failures or crashes

**Error Codes:**
| Code | User Message |
|------|-------------|
| `OCR_FAILED` | Your resume is mostly image-based and couldn't be read automatically. Please re-upload in DOCX or TXT format. |
| `OCR_INSUFFICIENT_TEXT` | Could not extract enough text from the image-based PDF. Please upload a text-based PDF, DOCX, or TXT file. |
| `PDF_PROCESSING_ERROR` | Could not extract text from PDF. Try DOCX/TXT format. |
| `DOCX_PROCESSING_ERROR` | Could not extract text from DOCX. Try newer format or TXT. |
| `CONTENT_TOO_SHORT` | File appears empty or contains insufficient text. |
| `FILE_TOO_LARGE` | File too large (max 15MB). Please reduce size. |

#### 4️⃣ **AI Tailoring Enhancements**
- ✅ **Structure Preservation**: Maintains original CV sections (Contact, Summary, Experience, Education, Skills)
- ✅ **Natural Keyword Integration**: Job-specific keywords added naturally (max 1-2 per bullet)
- ✅ **Action Verb Enhancement**: Strong action verbs (Led, Delivered, Built, etc.)
- ✅ **Professional Language**: Achievement-driven, ATS-friendly content
- ✅ **Career Profile Generation**: 3-4 sentence professional summary with keywords

**Enhancement Functions:**
```typescript
// Main enhancement function
function enhanceResumeWithKeywords(cv: any, keywords: string[], jobTitle: string, companyName: string): any

// Generates professional career profile
function generateProfessionalCareerProfile(existingSummary: string, cv: any, jobTitle: string, companyName: string, keywords: string[]): string
```

#### 5️⃣ **Quality Validation**
- ✅ **Content Validation**: Minimum 50 characters, resume keyword checks
- ✅ **Structure Validation**: Checks for preserved sections and enhancements
- ✅ **Tailoring Score**: Quality score based on keyword integration and structure
- ✅ **PDF Generation**: Clean, readable PDF output with proper formatting

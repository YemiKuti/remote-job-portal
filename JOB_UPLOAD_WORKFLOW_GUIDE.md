# Job Upload Workflow Testing Guide üìã

## Overview
This guide tests the complete job upload workflow to ensure CSV/XLSX uploaded jobs require admin approval before going live on the frontend.

## Current Workflow (Already Implemented ‚úÖ)

### 1. CSV Upload Process
- CSV jobs are uploaded via Admin Dashboard
- All uploaded jobs automatically get `status: 'pending'`
- Jobs DO NOT appear on public job listings until approved

### 2. Admin Approval System
- Pending jobs appear in Admin Dashboard
- Admins can approve or reject each job individually
- Only approved jobs (status: 'active') appear on frontend

### 3. Frontend Display
- Public job listings only show jobs with `status: 'active'`
- Pending/draft jobs remain hidden from candidates

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Upload Test CSV
1. **Go to Admin Dashboard** ‚Üí Jobs section
2. **Click "Upload Jobs"** button
3. **Upload the test file**: `JOB_UPLOAD_WORKFLOW_TEST.csv`
4. **Verify upload success** - should see 3 jobs processed

### Step 2: Check Admin Dashboard

### Step 3: Verify Frontend (Before Approval)
1. **Go to public job listings** (`/jobs`)
2. **Confirm the 3 uploaded jobs DO NOT appear**
3. **Search for company names** (TechCorp, GrowthStudio, DataMinds)
4. **Verify no results found** - jobs are not public yet

### Step 4: Approve One Job

5. **Confirm approval** 
6. **Verify status changes** to "Active"

2. **Verify job details display correctly**:

   - Requirements list
   - Email application: jobs@techcorp.com
3. **Test "Apply" button** - should open email client

### Step 7: Approve Second Job
1. **Return to Admin Dashboard**
2. **Approve "Marketing Manager" position**
3. **Verify both approved jobs** now appear on frontend
4. **Leave "Data Analyst Intern" as pending**

### Step 8: Final Verification

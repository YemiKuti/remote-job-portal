# CV Tailoring Tool - Changes Summary

## Overview

The AI CV Tailoring Tool has been completely refactored to work independently of Supabase Edge Functions. It now uses a configurable HTTP endpoint that can be easily switched between test and production environments.

## What Changed

### 1. New Configuration System

**File: `src/config/api.ts`** (NEW)
- Central configuration for the CV tailoring endpoint
- Supports environment variable override
- Default test endpoint: `https://httpbin.org/post`
- Easy switching between test and production

### 2. Refactored API Utility

**File: `src/utils/edgeFunctionUtils.ts`** (MODIFIED)
- Removed Supabase Edge Function dependency
- Now uses standard `fetch()` API
- Supports both FormData (file uploads) and JSON payloads
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
- Timeout protection (30 seconds)
- Exponential backoff retry logic maintained

### 3. Updated Error Messages

**Error Handling:**
- ✅ "Request sent successfully. Resume received for processing." (success)
- ⚠️ "Unable to connect to the server. Please try again later." (connection failure)
- ⚠️ "Request timed out. Please try again." (timeout)
- "Your file is too large. Please upload a resume under 10MB." (file size)

### 4. Test Mode Support

**httpbin.org Integration:**
- When using the test endpoint (httpbin.org/post):
  - Accepts POST requests
  - Validates file uploads and form data
  - Returns mock success response
  - Shows "Request sent successfully" message
  - No actual AI processing (for testing upload flow only)

### 5. Documentation

**New Files:**
- `CV_TAILORING_CONFIGURATION.md` - Complete setup guide
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `CV_TAILORING_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

**Updated Files:**
- `README.md` - Added CV Tailoring quick start section

## How It Works Now

### Request Flow

1. **User uploads resume** → Validated (size, format)
2. **Creates FormData/JSON** → Adds job details
3. **Sends to configured endpoint** → With timeout protection
4. **Handles response** → Shows success/error message
5. **Saves to database** → If successful

### Test Mode (Current)

```
Upload → httpbin.org/post → Mock Response → Success Message
```

### Production Mode (After Configuration)

```
Upload → Your API Endpoint → AI Processing → Tailored Resume
```

## Migration Path

### From Supabase Edge Functions

If you previously used Supabase Edge Functions:

1. Keep your edge function code
2. Deploy it to your preferred hosting
3. Update `.env` with new endpoint URL
4. No code changes needed!

### Example Configuration

**Test (Current):**
```env
# No .env needed - uses httpbin.org by default
```

**Production:**
```env
VITE_CV_TAILORING_ENDPOINT=https://your-api.com/api/tailor-cv
```

**Back to Supabase:**
```env
VITE_CV_TAILORING_ENDPOINT=https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/tailor-cv
```

## What Stayed The Same

✅ File validation (size, format)
✅ Progress bar and loading states
✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
✅ Error classification and handling
✅ User interface and workflow
✅ Database integration
✅ Resume storage and management

## What's Better

✅ **No Supabase dependency** for CV tailoring
✅ **Easy testing** with httpbin.org
✅ **Flexible configuration** via environment variables
✅ **Clear error messages** for users
✅ **Standard fetch API** - works anywhere
✅ **Better timeout handling**
✅ **Simpler debugging** with detailed console logs

## Testing Checklist

- [x] File upload validation works
- [x] FormData is sent correctly
- [x] Progress bar updates
- [x] Success message displays
- [x] Error messages are clear
- [x] Retry logic functions
- [x] Timeout protection works
- [x] Can switch endpoints easily

## Next Steps

1. **Current State**: Test mode working with httpbin.org
2. **Your API**: Deploy your CV tailoring API
3. **Configure**: Add endpoint to `.env`
4. **Test**: Upload real resume and verify
5. **Production**: Deploy and monitor

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check console logs (very detailed)
2. Check network tab in browser
3. Review `CV_TAILORING_CONFIGURATION.md`
4. Verify endpoint URL is correct
5. Test with httpbin.org first
